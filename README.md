## About / synopsis

Project Alchemy is a tool intended to allow VR devs to easily implement an alchemy system in an experience. The tool is intended to work by allowing users to interact with various ingredients in the environment, prepare them in various ways, and combine them in a medium of the devâ€™s choice to output a potion. To accomplish this, we are using Unity as an engine and writing scripts in C# to keep track of any inherent properties of ingredients, and handle any objects that need to be added, removed, or modified in the scene. The tool is being developed using OpenXR to allow for cross platform development as well.
